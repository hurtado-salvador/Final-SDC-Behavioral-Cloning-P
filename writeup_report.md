Behavioral Cloning Project
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
Summarize the results with a written report


RUBRIC POINTS
Required Files:
1.- My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

Quality of Code:
2.- Submission includes functional code Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, 
the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing:
python drive.py model.h5

3.- Submission code is usable and readable
The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. 
The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments 
to explain how the code works.

Model architecture and training strategy:
4.- Has an appropriate model architecture been employed for the task?


5.- Has an attempt been made to reduce overfitting of the model?


6.- Have the model parameters been tuned appropriately?



7.- Is the training data chosen appropriately?


Architecture and Training Documentation:
8.- Is the solution design documented?

9.- Is the model architecture documented?

10.- Is the creation of the training dataset and training process documented?

11.- Is the car able to navigate correctly on test data?
